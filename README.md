# Spotify-Clone-HTML-CSS-
This project is a Spotify web player clone created using only HTML and CSS. It simulates the user interface of Spotify's music player, complete with navigation options, a library, music cards, and a music player at the bottom. The clone is built entirely using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, without any JavaScript or backend functionality.
